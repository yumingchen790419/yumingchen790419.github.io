I am a board-certified psychiatrist at <a href='https://www.vghtpe.gov.tw/'>Taipei Veterans General Hospital</a> in Taiwan. I earned an additional degree in mathematics and computer science after medical school, which allows me to approach mental health from both clinical and computational perspectives.

As a psychiatrist, I aim to leverage diverse data modalities—including text, speech, visual behavioral data, physiological signals, and brain images—to develop AI models that facilitate precision psychiatry and personalized interventions. This approach enhances diagnostic accuracy and enables personalized treatment plans. 

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights, I aim to revolutionize how we diagnose, treat, and support individuals with mental health conditions. Through my work, I strive to enhance care quality, improve patient outcomes, and make mental healthcare more accessible and effective for all.
