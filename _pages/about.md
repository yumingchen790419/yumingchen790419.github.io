I am a board-certified psychiatrist at <a href='https://www.vghtpe.gov.tw/'>Taipei Veterans General Hospital</a> in Taiwan. To address mental healthcare challenges through data-driven approaches, I earned an additional degree in mathematics and computer science after medical school. This allows me to approach mental health from both clinical and computational perspectives.

As a psychiatrist, I'm particularly interested in the social interactions, behavioral manifestations and psychosocial interventions of autism. I'm currently undergoing a fellowship in child and adolescent psychiatry to specialize further. My goal is to combine my clinical expertise in assessing social cognition, interactions, and behaviors with my mathematics and computer science background to develop artificial social intelligence. This innovative approach will lay the foundation for digital interventions like embodied AI-agent augmented social skill training and cognitive behavioral therapy.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights, I aim to revolutionize how we diagnose, treat, and support individuals with autism and other mental health conditions. Through my work, I strive to enhance care quality, improve patient outcomes, and make mental healthcare more accessible and effective for all.
