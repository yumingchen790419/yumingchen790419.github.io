I am a board-certified psychiatrist working at <a href='https://www.vghtpe.gov.tw/'>Taipei Veterans General Hospital</a> in Taiwan. Driven by the desire to address challenges in mental healthcare through a data-driven approach, I pursued an additional degree in mathematics and computer science after graduating from medical school. This unique combination of expertise allows me to approach mental health issues from both clinical and computational perspectives.

In my career as a psychiatrist, I have developed a particular interest in the social interactions and behavioral manifestations of autism. To further specialize in this area, I am currently undergoing fellowship training in child and adolescent psychiatry. My goal is to combine my clinical expertise with my background in mathematics and computer science to develop artificial social intelligence. This innovative approach will serve as the foundation for future digital interventions in mental healthcare practice, such as social skill training and cognitive behavioral therapy.

By leveraging cutting-edge technology and data-driven insights, I aim to revolutionize the way we diagnose, treat, and support individuals with autism and other mental health conditions. Through my work, I strive to enhance the quality of care, improve patient outcomes, and make mental healthcare more accessible and effective for all.
