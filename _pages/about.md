I am a board-certified psychiatrist at <a href='https://www.vghtpe.gov.tw/Index.action'>Taipei Veterans General Hospital</a> in Taiwan. I earned an additional degree in mathematics and computer science after medical school, which allows me to approach mental health from both clinical and computational perspectives.

My research lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and psychiatry. I focus on leveraging diverse data modalities to develop foundational models that drive precision psychiatry and personalized interventions. Additionally, I am interested in exploring the potential of large language models and computer vision technologies to enhance therapeutic sessions.

By integrating cutting-edge technology with data-driven insights, my mission is to revolutionize the way we diagnose, treat, and support individuals with mental health conditions. Through this work, I strive to improve care quality, enhance patient outcomes, and make mental healthcare more accessible and effective for all.
